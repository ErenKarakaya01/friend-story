# FriendStory

This is a Flutter and Firebase starter project that includes a register and login system, and allows users to write their thoughts about their friends, accept or reject thoughts, and display accepted thoughts from their friends. 

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, you'll need to have [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) installed on your machine. After cloning this repository, navigate to the project directory and run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

Next, you'll need to create a Firebase project and add your project's `google-services.json` file to the `android/app` directory and `GoogleService-Info.plist` to the `ios/Runner` directory.
