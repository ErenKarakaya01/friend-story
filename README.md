# FriendStory

This is a Flutter and Firebase starter project that includes a register and login system, and allows users to write their thoughts about their friends, accept or reject thoughts, and display accepted thoughts from their friends. 

## Getting Started

Next, you'll need to create a Firebase project and add your project's `google-services.json` file to the `android/app` directory and `GoogleService-Info.plist` to the `ios/Runner` directory.
